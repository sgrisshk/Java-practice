2. Advanced Puzzles and Strategies

	#Inspect Everything:
	•	Always inspect your surroundings before taking action. Use inspect room to uncover hidden objects, traps, or clues.
	Often, critical items are tucked away in hard-to-spot locations.

	#Item Combinations:
	•	Sometimes, progress requires using specific items together. For example, if you find a key but the door remains locked,
	you may need to use an item like a crowbar or lockpick to gain access.

	#Search for Clues:
	•	Some rooms may contain hidden messages or objects that reveal clues. Look for notes, symbols, or unusual features in the environment.

	#Multiple Endings:
	•	Your actions influence the outcome of the game. For example:
	    • If you decide to use item in the right place, you may trigger the Good Ending, where the world is saved.
	    • However, failing to use an item in time may lead to a Bad Ending, where destruction occurs.

3. Enemy Encounters & Dangerous Situations


	#Fight or Flight:
	•	You will encounter situations where you must decide to fight, run, or hide.
	    Combat isn’t always the best choice—sometimes, running or hiding is the safest bet.

	#Using the Environment:
        •	In some scenarios, you can use your environment to your advantage.
        For example, blocking a door with heavy objects may prevent enemies from entering or give you time to escape.

	#Avoiding Traps:
        •	Pay attention to your surroundings. If you see something suspicious,
            it’s likely a trap. Use inspect room to detect potential hazards, and defuse trap if you’re sure of its location.

4. Story Progression and Key Moments

    The game’s story is non-linear, meaning there are multiple paths to success (or failure). Some key points to keep in mind:

        For example: You used the item to stabilize the machine and saved the facility from destruction.


	#Bad Ending:
        •	On the flip side, if you make a wrong decision or ignore crucial information, the game can end disastrously.
        For example: You ignored the warning and triggered the self-destruct sequence. Game Over.


5. Hidden Secrets

Some areas in the game contain hidden secrets or easter eggs that can impact gameplay:

	#Secret Passages:
	•	Occasionally, you’ll stumble upon secret passages by using commands like search room or open secret passage. These often lead to hidden treasures or shortcuts.
	#Unlockable Content:
	•	Some actions may unlock extra content or additional endings. Be sure to try different approaches, as there may be more to the game than meets the eye.
